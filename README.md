We built this Java-based application to search for and compare NBA players and their seasons throughout history. We built it using JavaFX. We used Java 17.0.8 version, which worked best with our tools. We built it using the built-in Maven editor in IntelliJ. To run this project, move all the files listed in this repository into an IDE (preferably IntelliJ, as that is what we used). Then, you should run the code through the 'Main.java' file. This should open the application window and show you an introductory message. You may then input any NBA player into the text field. If the player exists, it should return a list of all their seasons and their statistics. You can sort these seasons by points, rebounds, or assists.
