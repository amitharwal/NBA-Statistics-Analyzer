# 3560-Final-Project
A repository that holds all files for Aryan, Jerold, and Addison's final CS 3560, Spring 2025 term project.
# NBA Statistics Analyzer

## Project Description
This is a Java-based application we built to search for and compare NBA players and their seasons throughout history. We built it using JavaFX. We used Java 17.0.8 version, which worked best with our tools. We built it using the built-in Maven editor in IntelliJ. To run this project, move all the files listed in this repository into an IDE (preferably IntelliJ, as that is what we used). Then, you should run the code through the 'Main.java' file. This should open the application window and show you an introductory message. You may then input any NBA player into the text field. If the player exists, then it should return a list of all their seasons and their statistics for those seasons. You can sort these seasons by points, rebounds, or assists.

## Features (Mostly Explained in Description)
- **NBA Player Sort**
- **JavaFx Framework**
- **NBA Player Comparison**
- **Sorting Statistics by PRA**

## Future Work
We should work on properly deploying this application as a downloadable app. However, that costs money and may only be viable if this app introduces more features. Therefore, we should work on adding more interesting and eye-popping features. We could add more team-based features rather than only player-based features.
